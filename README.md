## Band Website

This is a website I made for my favorite band. For my website I went for a minimalist design, easy for users to navigate through the website, easy for them to read the words and made it not very cluttered by organizing and using almost the same color tones throughout the website. 


## Design Process
This website is ideally for metalheads who are into metal rock music, new fans who just found out about this band, people who are looking for new bands or music genre to listen to or aspiring musicians. Before beginning to design the website, I wrote down things I’d want to have in a website, I also visited a lot of websites to see and experience if it was easy to navigate through a website as a user standpoint, and from there, I took notes of the difficulties, challenges like how messy the website were and not make the same mistake. As per seen below, attached are files of my ideas and my finalized idea using Adobe XD.

From the most top page of the website is my cover page. There is the navigation bar, on the top right, for easy access and it is very eye catching for users, especially for first time users who just visited the website. And a button for users to enter the website, to go to the next page.


Moving on to the merchandise page, we have 4 buttons that says “Add to cart”. Also before that, there’s a dropdown list where interested buyers can purchase their preferred merchandise and choose their size before clicking on the “Add To Cart Button”. As seen, the navigation bars follows throughout as we scroll down making it easy for users to navigate around the website. In the future, I would implement a “Add to cart function page”, allowing users to choose the amount of quantity they want, payment they’d prefer to do. Or their preferred merchandise to “Cart” or “Wishlist”

Scrolling down more, there’s the Albums page. Using the flexbox method. In the future, I would want to let users be able to listen to the music, or watch the band’s music video or live concert videos without leaving the website. As in, while reading the information from the albums section, the album picture can be flipped leading them to the video.

Scrolling after the Album Page is the About Band section. I’ve embedded a music link for like demo/teaser of the band’s music. Especially helpful for people who are new to the band and wants to get a glimpse of what kind of music the band makes. 

After that is the Contact Page, also using flexbox function. Below the Contact page is the Where Should We Tour Next, using form method to create it. And there’s the submit button after users are completed with it. If possible, in the future, I’d like to implement a “Polling Feature” where both fans and band can see which country/city has the highest vote to perform there. And I also included a scroll to top button so users don’t have to scroll all the way up.


## Technology used:
-	.HTML (to build the website, write information of the band)
-	.CSS     (to beautify the website, to organize how my HTML elements should look like)
-	.JS        (to make web page interactive)
